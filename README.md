Virtual bookshelf: web portal for the home library
Description: the goal of this project is to design and develop the web portal for the home library.

The web portal must provide the following functionality: 
(1) add the new book to the library; 
(2) remove the book from the library; 
(3) display the books that satisfy the selection criteria, for example, books of the specified author or books published after 2020 or books in the selected category "Programming".

Each record for the book must contain the following attributes: title, author, publisher, year when
published, category, ISBN. The web portal shall allow users to create their accounts. Only strong passwords of 10+ characters shall be accepted. To login on the web portal, a user must provide valid credentials. Access control policies should support two roles: administrator, user. Administrators shall be able to add new books to the library database and remove existing books. Users and administrators shall be able to view relevant book records from the database that satisfy the selection criteria.
